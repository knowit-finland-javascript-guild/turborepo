<v-clicks>

- Starting with a monorepo vs converting something into a monorepo
- a) converting a monolith into a monorepo
- b) converting a bunch of microservices + packages into a monorepo

<v-clicks>

Some important concepts

- workspace vs root

# Working in monorepo

- tsconfig

---

# Some important concepts

- What is actually happening? Symlinks
- hoisting packages
- When does a package reside in app/node_modules? When in root/node_modules?
- Needing to use something like vite/babel
- Adding new workspaces

---

# Things to consider

- how to install new external packages?
  - harmonizing
- editor support
- converting with git history retained
